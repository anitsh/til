# Today I Learn

Learning should be open and fun and only then it can 
add value. To make it fun, the learning envirionment
must be unbiased, collaborative and participative. 
Inorder to create value from learning, such environment 
is as important as the quality of the content. Therefore,
this is my way of learning where everyone is welcome 
to participate. Please do comment kindly, and contribute
as you see fit.


### About The Repository
[Issues](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues) is the main learning management system. 
The topic are mainly tech related but could be anything 
random.

The nature of issues here are supposed to be short lived,
few hours or few days kind of issue but I have come to 
realize that does not happen. Anyways, I wish to have 
short lived issues like blog posts and brief overview 
of a tech stack here.

The collection used to be in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/GGhug4Bh/journey-of-a-software-engineer). 
I loved collecting the resources there but realized
I wanted some more to take notes so moved here. But
I still feel it is a great utility and will be adding
more there as well.

For indepth study materials, please visit [ReadersClub](https://github.com/ReadersClub/readersclub.github.io/issues)
which includes books and many online courses 
that get my hands on. This is also open
sourced if you would like participate.


If you have anything to ask, please create an [issue](https://github.com/codeanit/ama/issues).

Thank you.
